# .dotfiles †
A collection of configuration files and scripts I use to setup my desktop operating systems.

† In Unix-like operating systems, any file or folder that starts with a dot character (for example, `/home/user/.config`), commonly called a dot file or dotfile, is to be treated as hidden – that is, the `ls` command does not display them unless the `-a` flag (`ls -a`) is used. In most command-line shells, wildcards will not match files whose names start with `.` unless the wildcard itself starts with an explicit `.`.
